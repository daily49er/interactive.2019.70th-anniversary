		                Alumna Jo Murray of 1982 remembers the Soroptimist House, the now empty, caution-taped
						building that used to be a thriving center for advocacy, wellness and community on-campus.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						“It’s bittersweet,” said Murray, who chaired concerts held in the outdoor terrace with her
						husband in 1986 and enjoyed the afternoon tea services in high school.
						The building, one of the oldest on campus, served as an inexpensive venue to rent on campus.
						The dated furniture and mid-century architecture appealed to the students since it felt retro
						compared to the rest of campus.
					</p>
					<br></br>

					<p>
					The house was built in 1957 and gifted to Associated Students Inc., according to James
					Ahumada, senior communications manager of ASI. It was then used as the school’s first student
					union, where students gathered and relax between classes.
					</p>

					<br></br>
					<p>
					However, after years on campus, it’s being replaced by an alumni center. The decision was
					made before the Ridgecrest Earthquake on July 4 left the Soroptimist House red-tagged and
					deemed unsafe. The Interfaith Center last used it two weeks prior to the earthquake, but had
					already moved to another location.
					</p>

					<br></br>
					<p>
					“It’s exciting to have progress, but it’s sad to not have something that embraces our history on
					campus,” Murray said.
					</p>


					<br></br>
					<p>
					Throughout the years, it has been used for multiple events including weddings and Poet’s
					Lounge. The ownership was transferred to the university in recent years, where it continued to
					hold events and meetings. The Soroptimist International of Long Beach has used it for
					meet-and-greets, but nothing in the past five years.
					</p>

					<br></br>
					<p>
					Soroptimist International has embraced the news, but are sad to let it go.
					“I think times have changed; it’s no longer a viable house,” said ​Judy Murphy​, president of
					Soroptimist International of Long Beach. “It’s served its purpose all those years...We are okay
					with that. We are happy that it’s been used for so long and so well...You have to let it go, but
					that’s what happens. Times change.”
					</p>

					<br></br>
					<p>
					According to Mark Zakhour,​ ​director of design and construction services, the canopy in
					particular was unsafe and the overall structure has gone beyond its replacement date.
					“It’s deteriorating, it’s old,” Zakhour said. “It was built in the ‘60s, so by the time you make all the
					seismic retrofits, make it compliant with the new energy codes, at that point you’re basically
					building a new building.”
					</p>

					<br></br>
					<p>
					Now, the space will become the 6,000 square feet Anna W. Ngai Alumni Center. The building
					will cost $8.5 million, and its funding will come exclusively from private donations. Construction
					will begin summer 2020.
					</p>

					<br></br>
					<p>
					Its design is in its first phase, so there has not been any confirmations as to how it will look.
					However, it will still be a place to hold events and a space for community and campus groups to
					convene, much like the Soroptimist House.
					</p>

					<br></br>
					<p>
					The new structure will pay tribute to the Soroptimist House by incorporating a plaque dedicated
					to the house and using pieces in the old structure in the alumni center.
					“It has a lot of great history and has done a lot for the campus, so we want to document it well
					and make sure it never gets forgotten,” Zakhour said.
